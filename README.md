# Appointment-Provider
Created an interactive appointment tracker using PostgreSQL to manage appointments for a beauty salon. 
A new user is asked to choose from a list fo available services, enter their phone and name and choose a time for their appointment.
If the phone number is in the database then the user only has to confirm the time for their appointment as their name is already recorded.
An output message is displayed at the end to confirm the appointment for the service.
